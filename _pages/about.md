I am an Assistant Professor in the department of [Electrical Engineering](https://www.nmt.edu/academics/eleceng/) at [New Mexico Tech](https://www.nmt.edu/). I have completed my M.S. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), USA in 2021 and 2022 respectively. Before joining UTSA, I received B.Sc. degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Khulna University of Engineering and Technology, Bangladesh in 2014. 

My research interest focuses on human factors and their impacts on cybersecurity, cyber-psychological assessment in cyber threat detection, and intelligent transportation system security. My research interest also includes AI security, computer vision, micro-expression analysis and intelligent sound synthesis. 

## Research Areas/Interests

* Machine Learning/ Deep Learning
* AI in Cyber Security
* Human Factor based Behavioral Abstraction and Modeling
* Insider Threat Analysis and Detection
* Driver and Driving Behavior Analysis for Vehicle Cyber Attack Detection
* Security of Autonomous Vehicles
* Intelligent Sound Synthesis
