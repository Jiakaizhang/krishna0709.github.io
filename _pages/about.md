<font size="3"> I am a PhD candidate in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). Currently, I am working as a graduate research assistant (GRA) in the [IoT Security Lab](https://engineering.utsa.edu/iotsecuritylab/), UTSA under the supervision of Dr. Qian Chen for around 3 years. My major research concentration is in the area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cybersecurity. I am designing novel AI models leveraging machine learning and deep learning algorithms for developing next generation cyber defense tools to protect the enterprise networks as well as cyber physical systems (CPS).

I am an enthusiastic researcher motivated to work in a challenging environment to bring team success through hard work, R&D skills, and creative thoughts.
