I am a PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). Currently, I am working as a graduate research assistant (GRA) in the IoT Security Lab, UTSA under the supervision of Dr. Qian Chen for around 3 years. My major research concentration is developing deep learning algorithms for developing next generation cyber defense tools.

I am an enthusiastic researcher motivated to work in a challenging environment to bring team success through hard work, R&D skills, and creative thoughts. Currently, I am doing research in the field of Cyber Security with a focus on Intrusion Detection System and Forensic Analysis leveraging deep learning algorithms. 

In my doctoral study, I was interested to work on data analytics for cybersecurity applications and therefore, I have always tried to attend related workshops, hackathons outside of class for improving skills. I did projects on host-based audit and application log data analysis for cyber threat detection using deep learning algorithms. In my current project, I am working with cyber (benign and malicious) and behavioral (psychological) datasets which I have collected in last one year in our IoT Security Lab for insider threat and advanced and persistent threat (APT) detection. In cyber threat intelligence provenance graph-based techniques are very effective and my current project also focused on applying AI models one of which is graph neural networks in our own provenance graphs. Therefore, I have experience working with multiple big datasets using ELK stack and deep learning algorithms in threat hunting applications which I believe make me a potential candidate for this internship position.
