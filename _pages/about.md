I am a PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). Currently, I am working as a graduate research assistant (GRA) in the IoT Security Lab, UTSA under the supervision of Dr. Qian Chen for around 3 years. My major research concentration is developing deep learning algorithms for developing next generation cyber defense tools.

I am an enthusiastic researcher motivated to work in a challenging environment to bring team success through hard work, R&D skills, and creative thoughts. Currently, I am doing research in the field of Cyber Security with a focus on Intrusion Detection System and Forensic Analysis leveraging deep learning algorithms.
